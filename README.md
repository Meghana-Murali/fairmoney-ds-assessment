### Project Overview

This repository contains the solution for the Senior Data Scientist take-home assessment from FairMoney. The assignment 
was divided into two independent tasks:

1.  **Feature Engineering:** To process semi-structured JSON credit report data and create a reusable function that extracts a rich set of predictive features.
2.  **Predictive Modeling:** To use a historical loan dataset (`credit.csv`) to train, validate, and interpret a machine learning model to predict loan default.

The goal was not only to build a high-performing model but also to demonstrate a professional, end-to-end data science workflow, from data analysis and critical thinking to clear communication of business impact.

### Summary of Key Findings & Recommendations

#### **Part 1: Feature Engineering**
*   Successfully engineered **58 features** from the raw JSON credit reports, covering categories like repayment history, delinquencies, credit-seeking behavior, and applicant stability.
*   The entire process was encapsulated into a single, reusable Python function.

#### **Part 2: Predictive Modeling**
*   Developed a tuned **XGBoost model** with a final **ROC AUC of 0.7845** on the test set.
*   **Key Insight:** Uncovered a highly counterintuitive pattern in the `credit_history` feature, flagging it as a potential data definition issue that requires business consultation.
*   **Ethical Consideration:** Explicitly excluded the `Gender` feature from the model to ensure a fair and responsible lending process.

#### **Final Business Recommendation**
The final model is a powerful tool for risk assessment. I recommend deploying it not as a simple approve/reject system, but as the foundation for a **strategic, risk-based lending policy**. By categorizing applicants into risk buckets (low, medium, high, very-high), FairMoney can optimize loan terms (e.g., adjust interest rates or loan amounts), thereby **maximizing approvals and revenue while mitigating credit losses.**
